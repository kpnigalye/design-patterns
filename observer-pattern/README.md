## Observer Pattern
- This is a behavioural design pattern in which an object called 'Subject' maintains a list of dependents called 'Observers' and notifies them about the state change by calling their update() or modify() method.
- This requires all observers to inherit from an 'Observer' interface which has an update() or modify() method.

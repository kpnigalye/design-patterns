## Strategy Pattern
- This is a behavioural design pattern which enables selecting an algorithm's behaviour at runtime. 
- Eg. Sort() method of ArrayList in C# internally uses strategy pattern to choose what kind of sorting strategy to use.
- the example covered calculates the final billing amount. It applies discount based on different amounts. Basically it decides which discount to apply based on the amount at runtime.
